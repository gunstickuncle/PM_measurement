Here are a few tops we have to discuss for tomorow:
- data structure (festlegen, gemeinsame Metatabelle erstellen)

  -> Tanja, Katrin
- map
- standart measurement procedure (how to measure?)

 -- measure every 2 seconds
 -> measurement timespan: 10 min (first 1,5 min will be cut of afterwards)
 -> file format: JSON and CSV (both)
 -> for every measurment point save one file -> merging will be done afterwards
    "Log-id"_"Obs-id".csv and "Log-id"_"Obs-id".json
 -> Hight: ~bike hight (~0.8m)
 -> building distance: > 0.5m (-> Metafile)
 -> Picture of every Point:  "Log-id"_"Obs-id".jpg
 -> Felix does a file with explanations
 
- fix time for the measurement?

  -> friday 11 am (after lecture) to ~1 pm
- Contact exchange, split up Groups

  -> one table with group spliting 2 tel. numbers
  -> Basti, Matze
